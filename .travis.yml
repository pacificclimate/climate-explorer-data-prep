# We can't run tests for ``generate_climos`` and ``split_merged_climos`` because installing cdo in Travis is
# just too hard: NetCDF support isn't built into the debian cdo pacakges.
# Once that is resolved (i.e., install the NetCDF support before installing cdo), the commented out code can be
# uncommented and the full test suite can be run. For now we just run the non cdo dependent tests.
